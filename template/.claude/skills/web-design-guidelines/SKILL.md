# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## How It Works

1. **Read `guidelines-snapshot.md` next to this file.** It ships with the project and contains
   the full rule set. It is the default source — no network required.
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the snapshot
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

The bundled snapshot is authoritative for normal reviews. Rules of web interface quality do
not turn over between one QA round and the next, and a fetch costs a round trip plus the
whole document again on every single review — inside a QA loop that repeats, that adds up
fast for no change in findings.

Fetch the upstream version **only** when one of these is true:

- `guidelines-snapshot.md` is missing or unreadable;
- the user explicitly asks for the latest upstream rules;
- you are refreshing the snapshot itself on purpose.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md
```

If you do fetch and the content differs meaningfully, write it back over
`guidelines-snapshot.md` so the next review starts from the newer copy.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Read the snapshot (see above)
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the snapshot
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
